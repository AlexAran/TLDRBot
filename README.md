# TLDRBot
Telegram bot that tracks keywords on a conversation so
later you can ask a summary


You can use it by joining a conversation with @TLDRBot
on Telegram.

Use /add to add keywords and /remove to remove keywords.
You can also check the keyword list using /list.

Then chat away and when you want to get a highlight of
a long list of unread messages just ask with /tldr.


If you want to make your own bot based on this code
be sure to follow Telegram's instructions on how to
create a new bot and to get an API key using BotFather.
